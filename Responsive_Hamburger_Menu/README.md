<p>A responsive hamburger menu is a type of user interface design pattern used on websites and mobile applications. It typically consists of a button with three horizontal lines, which when clicked, reveals a hidden menu that contains links to various pages or sections of the website.

The term "hamburger" refers to the button's appearance, which resembles a stacked hamburger. The menu is hidden by default, and the button only appears when the website is viewed on a smaller screen, such as a mobile device.

The responsive hamburger menu is designed to improve the user experience on smaller screens by providing a more streamlined and efficient way to navigate the website. It allows users to access the site's content without having to scroll through a lengthy navigation menu or cluttered interface.

Overall, the responsive hamburger menu is a popular and effective design pattern for mobile-responsive websites and applications.</p>
